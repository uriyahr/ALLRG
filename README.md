[ALLRG](http://uriyahr.github.io/ALLRG/) [allrgy simplified](http://uriyahr.github.io/ALLRG/) created by [Uriyah Ruiz, Riya Chandra, Shalini Kunapuli, Nicolle Ayon]. A free interactive guide for people with allergies eating away from home.

## MISSION STATEMENT

Founded in 2015, ALLRG: Allergies Simplified strives to facilitate the lives of those who have difficulty finding allergy friendly dishes at restaurants. One of the main goals is to allow users to be able to plan ahead, or even sit down at a restaurant, and be able to see a menu that is customized for their specific needs. At the end of the day, we just want to make life a little less stressful.



## Bugs and Issues
